# product-sales-analysis-python

Advanced Data Analytics project using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze fictional product sales data. The project covers total sales calculation, trend analysis over time, top-selling product insights, Pareto (80/20) analysis, and outlier detection. This is an **individual exploratory data analysis (EDA) project** built using Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It analyzes product-level sales and visual trends for a fictional retail dataset.

**The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world data analytics workflow including:**

- Data preparation
- Feature engineering
- Sales aggregation
- Trend analysis
- Visualization
- Pareto insight (80/20 rule)
- Outlier detection

## 📁 Dataset
A fictional dataset with the following columns was created manually:
- `Product`: Product name
- `Price`: Price per unit (₹)
- `Quantity`: Quantity sold
- `Date`: Transaction date

This dataset was created only for learning and demonstration purposes — **no copyrighted dataset was used**.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed

- Total sales by product with enhanced bar plot
- Time-series trend analysis of daily sales
- Pareto chart (80/20 analysis of top-selling products)
- Most sold product by quantity
- Outlier detection with boxplot
- Average transaction value
- Heatmap and sales timeline (optional extensions)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open the notebook (`Product_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells. No external dataset is needed — the sample dataset is created within the notebook.
